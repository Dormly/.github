# Dormly

Dormly is an in-development central hub for all things related to higher education institutions.

## Components
In order to streamline usability for students and faculty alike, Dormly is planned to include the following services:

### Student App
The Dormly Student App compiles services students commonly use into a single app, improving convenience and user experience. Planned services to be implemented include:
* Campus Map
* Digital Student ID
* Campus Events Calendar
* Dining Hall information
* Dorm Hall information & services
* Push notifications for package deliveries

### Residential Living Staff Website
The Dormly Residential Living Staff Website is used to manage residents living in residence halls.

### Residential Living Staff App
As a compliment to the website, the Dormly Residential Staff App enables 
dorm hall staff to quickly respond to situations, when time is a luxury. 
When responding to situations, dorm hall staff can quickly draft an incident report by scanning student IDs. 
To ensure resident information is kept secure while maintaining speed, biometrics are planned to be implemented for logging in. Drafts can then be completed through the 
website, after a situation has been handled.

### Dining Hall Employee Website
The Dining Hall Employee Website is a quick and easy way for dining hall employees to update menu items so students are aware of the food options available.
